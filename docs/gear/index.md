# Gear

The gear you'll need is highly depended on the targets you want to shoot. Moving forward I'll briefly talk about the different types/targets before discussing gear in more detail.

!!! note
    I won't recommend specific gear as there will always be the hot, new thing. Instead, I aim to give you a high level overview so you know what to look for.
    
    If you need specific advise try your local astronomy club or astrophotography comunities.
