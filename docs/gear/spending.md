# What to buy when?

Astrophotography is an expensive hobby there is (almost) no way around it. So I'm a big fan of natural progression and I want to talk about this first.

## Natural progression

I think it's quite easy to overspend, spend your money on the wrong thing or even spending not enough and having to buy the more expensive thing anyway later on.

Also, as cool as it's sounds, astrophotography isn't for everyone. You have to stay up late, be out in the cold and might have to travel to do it at all.

So I'm a big fan of getting a small, expandable, setup which you can grow into without spending too much and replace bit by bit as you outgrow it. This has some advantages:

- **Low initial cost to entry** - you don't need to spend a lot of money to get started and, if you notice it's not your cup of tea, you don't lose much money if at all.
- **Easy to get into** - you don't need to know all the things about sampling rate, guiding parameter, offset, gain, etc.
- **You get to know what you want to shoot** - so you won't buy a specialized telescope only to discover you want to shoot something else entirely.

But there are also drawbacks:

- **You will replace your gear sooner or later.** So you need to either sell it or keep it as a secondary rig.
- **Your images won't be as good as they could be.** But don't expect masterpieces with expensive gear whe just starting out either 😉

## A word on smart scopes

Smart scopes, like the SeeStar S50, are great if you are starting out. They offer a lot of features for a relatively low price. But they have one major flaw: you can't expand them and will outgrow them sooner or later. But again, they can be a great tool to get started.

## What to start with

If you don't want to start with a smart scope, look at what you already have. Have a DSLR with any lens? Perfect! Just have a smartphone? That's okay too. Just have  a tripod as you want to take long exposures and you can't do that by hand. That's basically all you need to start really.

Soon you'll encounter issues which might require some new gear: a ball head, intervalometer, better lens, dew heater ... you name it. Just go out there and start shooting ... and keep at it, that's the hard part in the beginning.

## Where to spend your money

A setup to start out need three things:

- A mount
- A camera
- A lens or telescope

There are a lot of things like autoguider, focuser, computer etc. but htese can be added later.

From these things one is more important than others: **the mount**. This is the foundation of everything else, here you want to spend the most of your money - not the camera and not the scope, the mount - and better buy to big than too small. This thing is what lets you track the stars at night (as these tend to move) and this is a major factor for getting usable images. If you have a good mount you can think about cameras and telescopes, these are equally important. Usually it's easier to update the lens to a telescope and after that updating the camera.
