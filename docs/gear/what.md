# What to shoot?

All of it? Then I have some bad new for you. There are different types of objects you might want to photograph which require widely different gear.

You could go for landscape or milky way photography, which is easy to do gear wise and is a great starting point, or you could get more involved and go after nebulae. What every strikes your fancy, I'll go over the most common types in the following sections.

## Milky Way
This is a great starting point if you just want to tip your toes into astrophotography. This typically involves a DSLR you might already own, some wide field lenses (up to ~50mm) and a tripod. 

You usually want to capture the milky way and with an interesting foreground.

## Lunar
The moon is one of the easier targets out there it doesn't require specialized gear and can be shot with a basic length with longer focal length.

## Deep Sky
In this category one takes images of deep sky objects like galaxies, nebulae and star clusters. This is more involved as it requires more specialized gear. You want a DSLR and long focal length lens (>200mm) - or a dedicated camera and scope - and a mount that tracks the night sky. This can easily be extended with auto guiding, filters, computers and a lot of other gadgets.

You then will take hundreds of images of the same patch of sky, combine (stack) these und spend a lot of time in front of the computer extracting the data.

## Planetary
If you capture images of deep sky objects you are typically exposing for a few minutes and combine multiple images to get those faint details.

Planets (and the moon) are bright objects so you don't need to expose for long periods. Also, you are not looking for fast telescopes but for ones with large focal lengths, up to multiple meters! You will then take a video of the target and combine only the best 5% of those to get a really sharp image.

Again, you'll spend a lot of time in front of the computer.

## Solar
That's the only category you could do during daytime as you take images of the sun.

!!! danger
    Obligatory reminder to never point your telescope directly onto the sun without appropriate filters as it will seriously damage your eyes and gear!

I don't have much experience in this field, but I know, that you need specialized telescopes and filters to capture images of the sun.
